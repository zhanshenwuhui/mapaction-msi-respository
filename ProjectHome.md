MapAction (www.mapaction.org) uses various common open source applications. Some of these have been repackaged as MSI installers, in order to integrate them with our desktop management systems. The MSIs and (where applicable) the Visual Studio files are shared here in the open that they are useful more widely.

MapAction is a not-for-profit organisation which provides a mapping information service at the scene of any major disaster. Using techniques including geographical positioning systems (GPS), satellite communications, geographical information systems (GIS), and personal observation, MapAction produce maps depicting the dynamic situation. These are freely distributed to relief agencies and are available on our website.
